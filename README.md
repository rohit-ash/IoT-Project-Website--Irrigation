# Project GROW- Self Sustaining Irrigation System
Project done as a part of the course - Internet of Things (ECOE-23) at NIT Trichy.

# Abstract
The World is currently facing a very big problem in the name of water 
scarcity. 

Especially in India, where 60-70% economy depends on agriculture, 
there is a great need to modernize conventional agricultural practices 
for better productivity. 

Through this project, we aim to solve the big problem of water 
scarcity in rural areas, by implementing a self-sustaining irrigation 
system using Sensors and IoT Technology. 

Our project aims to maintain the optimal moisture level in the soil, 
hence curbing the problem of over watering plants which results in 
wastage of water as well as damage to the plant. 

Hence by doing this project, we attempt to counter the problem of 
wastage of water(overwatering) in agriculture, by using weather 
forecasts as well as the current soil moisture level to water plants only 
when soil moisture level goes below a particular threshold.
